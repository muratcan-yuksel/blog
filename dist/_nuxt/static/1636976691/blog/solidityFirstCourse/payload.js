I'm already working as a front end web developer, so I know JS, ReactJS, VueJS (which is the language used in this blog, well, NuxtJS to be precise but you get the point) alongside with other things. While web development, be it front end, full stack or whatever, is quite interesting, I think this web3 thing is the future. You might as well say, Murat, what the hell you know about the trends in technology and society and so on and I'd say, well, not much, but I see that people are talking about this stuff, and bearing the success of crypto coins in mind, I believe blockchain development might turn out to be quite a good career choice. It's already going mainstream, so it's best to catch the trend. I don't want to look back in a couple of years and say \"I wish I'd started writng smart contracts earlier...\""}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:d,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"So here I am, learning solidity in my free time, slowly for sure, but better than nothing.
